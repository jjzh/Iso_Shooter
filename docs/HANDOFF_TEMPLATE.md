# [Prototype Name] Handoff

> Copy this template to `HANDOFF.md` at the root of each `explore/` branch.
> Fill it in as you work. This is the context bridge between sessions and machines.

## Vision
One paragraph: what is this prototype exploring? What design question are we answering?

## Reference Games
- [Game 1] — what specific aspect we're borrowing (e.g., "Hades — encounter pacing, dash-cancel combat")
- [Game 2] — secondary reference if applicable

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** `explore/[name]`
- **Forked from:** `main` at commit `[hash]`
- **Last updated:** [date]

## Systems Added
List every new file or major modification, one per line:
- `src/path/file.ts` — one-line description of what it does

## Systems Modified (from main)
- `src/path/file.ts` — what changed and why

## What Feels Good
Capture specific moments or interactions that feel right:
- [Observation about what works, be specific — "dashing through a cluster of goblins feels responsive because..."]

## What Doesn't Work Yet
- [Problem or missing piece]
- [Thing that felt wrong and why]

## Key Config Values
Parameters that were tuned to get the current feel. Include enough context to understand why:
- `PLAYER.speed`: [value] — [why this works for this prototype]
- `ABILITIES.dash.duration`: [value] — [observation about how it affects feel]

## Open Questions
Design questions still unresolved:
- [Question about a mechanic or system]
- [Decision that needs playtesting to answer]

## Merge Candidates
Systems worth bringing back to `main` because they're general-purpose:
- `src/path/system.ts` — [why it's useful beyond this prototype]

## Session Log
Brief notes from each work session (most recent first):
- **[date]** — [what was done, key decisions, what to pick up next]
